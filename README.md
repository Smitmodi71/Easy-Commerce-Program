# Project for CS 122A

This project works like the mini e-commerce website. This is a software only project completed in C++. Some of the topics we have learned in the class have been used in order for it to correlate with embedded systems. Three topics I have included in the project are State Machines, Troubleshooting and Pattern recognition.
